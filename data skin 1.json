      "description": "Animatronics refers to the use of robotic technology in creating lifelike creatures, characters or other figures. The term is derived from a combination of “animation” and “electronics,” and animatronics are used in a wide range of applications, from theme park attractions to film and television production. Animatronics have come a long way since their introduction in the mid-20th century and have revolutionized the entertainment industry, bringing fictional characters to life in a way that was once thought impossible."

      "description": "The idea of animating figures for entertainment purposes dates back centuries, with early examples including clockwork automatons and puppet shows. However, the modern concept of animatronics can be traced back to Walt Disney, who developed the first animatronic figure for Disneyland’s Enchanted Tiki Room in 1963. The figure was a talking parrot, and it was operated by a system of cams, levers, and motors. The success of this attraction led to the development of more complex animatronic figures, including the famous Abraham Lincoln figure in the Hall of Presidents."

      "description": "During the 1970s and 1980s, animatronics technology continued to evolve, with the development of computer-controlled systems that allowed for more precise movements and facial expressions. This led to the creation of some of the most iconic animatronic figures in history, including the Terminator in the 1984 film of the same name and the dinosaurs in the 1993 blockbuster Jurassic Park."

      "description": "Animatronics are complex systems that involve a combination of mechanical, electrical, and computer-controlled components. At their most basic level, animatronics consist of a framework or skeleton that supports the figure’s movements, a set of motors or servos that control these movements, and sensors or other input devices that allow the figure to respond to its environment. In addition, many animatronics also include a range of cosmetic elements, including skin, fur, or feathers, that give them a lifelike appearance."

      "description": "The control system for an animatronic figure can be relatively simple or extremely complex, depending on the level of detail and sophistication required. In some cases, the figure’s movements are pre-programmed, with a series of inputs controlling its actions. In other cases, the figure is able to respond to inputs from its environment, such as motion sensors or pressure plates."

They may be driven by a range of different types of motors, including DC motors, stepper motors, or servo motors. In some cases, the motors may be directly attached to the figure’s limbs or other components, while in others they may be connected via cables or other mechanisms."

In some cases, the control system may be simple, with a single microcontroller or other embedded system. In other cases, the control system may be more complex, with multiple microcontrollers or other processors working together to control the figure."
